# Hyrule Cookbook
(WIP) Hyrule Cookbook is a minimalist web app for users to view recipe information and track recipe completion for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

### Planned features:
- view recipe information such as recipe id, name, and ingredients
- search/filter recipes by name & id
- integrating a custom REST API with all recipe information (working on creating one)

### Current tech stack:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js and Express
- Database: tbd
